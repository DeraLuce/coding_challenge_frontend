# Hierarchical dropdown

Your task is to create a hierarchical dropdown menu in the style of the main mediamarkt.de navigation. Include one level of subnavigation and category headings. See the screenshots below, or visit the live site. You should not spend more than 2h on this. If it is unfinished, that's okay. You may use any CSS processors, and JavaScript, as you see fit.

After finishing, please send us a pull request.

We are not interested in a pixel-perfect design. In HTML our focus is on conciseness, expressiveness, and semantics; in CSS and JS weâ€™re looking for clarity, terseness, and maintainability.

## Browser Support Matrix

The dropdown should work in the evergreen browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari latest two versions). If you have time, maybe think about what would need to change if you also had to support IE11.
